# Iris Flower Classification Using Streamlit (Fasilkom/Pusilkom UI)

Welcome to the **Iris Flower Classification App**! This interactive web application leverages the power of machine learning to classify Iris flowers based on user input, specifically using a **Random Forest Classifier**. 

A demo of the app running is available at: https://iris-classification-ui.streamlit.app/

## Project Overview

This project provides a simple tool for classifying the species of Iris flowers. The app is designed with an intuitive user interface that allows users to enter specific measurements related to an Iris flower's **sepal length**, **sepal width**, **petal length**, and **petal width**. Based on these inputs, the application predicts the Iris species, identifying it as one of the three known classes:

- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

The model used for classification is a **Random Forest Classifier**, a reliable and widely used machine learning algorithm that is well-suited for this type of multi-class classification problem. The classifier has been trained on the classic Iris dataset, known for its simplicity and effectiveness in demonstrating basic classification techniques.

## Usage

1. **Input Measurements**: Enter the desired values for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width in the provided slider inputs.
2. **Get Prediction**: Just click Predict class and the app will instantly display the predicted Iris species based on the input measurements.

**Happy classifying!**
